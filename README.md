Look is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://look.ping.pub .

## What is difference between Look and other explorers? 

Look is designed to explore blockchain data as real as possible, therefore there is no cache, no analysis. Look does not cache/save blockchain data on its server. Look only fetch data from Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints. We call it "Light Explorer".
