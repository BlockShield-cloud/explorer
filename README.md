Look is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://look.ping.pub .

## What is the difference between Look and other explorers? 

Look is designed to explore blockchain data as real as possible, therefore there is no cache, no analysis. Look does not cache/save blockchain data on its server. Look only fetch data from Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints. We call it "Light Explorer".

## Do you want Look to explore your blockchain?

If you want Look to explore your blockchain, pull a request [here](https://github.com/liangping/look/issues), We will explore your chains as soon as possibe. And the most important thing is that Look is free for all public cosmos-based blockchains.

Look是一个轻浏览器，免费为所有的基于Cosmos-SDK开发的区块链提供浏览服务

# Look 和其他区块链有什么不同？

Look的设计理念是尽可能的保持数据的真实性，所以，他会在服务器端缓存或者保存任何数据，增加任何分析处理。它仅仅通过LCD/RPC来获取他所需要的所有数据。因此我们叫它“轻浏览器”。

# 你希望Look来浏览你的区块链吗？
